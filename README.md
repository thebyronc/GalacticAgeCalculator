## Behavior Driven Specifications
- Take a personâ€™s age in years and convert it into seconds.
- Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)
- Return the age of a human in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
- Return the age of a human in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
- If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, your application should account for (and test) this possible outcome as well.
